* Description
This layer adds an alternative modal editing mode for Emacs.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"like vi, but the design of key/command choice is based on command frequency statistics and ease-of-key score. Most frequently used commands have most easy keys."
#+END_QUOTE

[[http://ergoemacs.org/misc/ergoemacs_vi_mode.html][xah-fly-keys]] has been developed over years of experience by Xah Lee, a long time contributer to the Emacs community.

Gain the modal superpowers of the dark side, without succumbing to evil!

** Features:

- You NEVER need to press 【Ctrl+x】or Meta! Use a leader key instead!
- There are about 200 commands with leader key sequences.
- Efficient keys for common navigation and editing tasks in command mode.
- The key bindings are based on experience and [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/command-frequency.html][observed frequency of use]].

* Install
Clone this repository into =.emacs.d/private/xah-fly-keys=, or where ever you
keep your private layers.

To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =xah-fly-keys= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in 
this file. You should have the =dotspacemacs-editing-style= set to ='emacs=.

It is recommended to change some of the defaults in your =.spacemacs= file, in
order to avoid some unwanted cross-over with some key bindings.

  - set the =dotspacemacs-leader-key= to an empty string, as having it set to 
    =SPC= interferes with the =which-key= mappings.
  - set =dotspacemacs-colorize-cursor-according-to-state nil= so that the cursor
    will reflect the =xah-fly-keys= state instead.

** Configuration

This layer assumes a =qwerty= layout and uses that by default. You can configure
xah-fly-keys to use other keyboard layouts with the =xah-fly-keys-layout=
variable.

The possible values are:
- =azerty=, =azerty-be=
- =colemak=, =colemak-mod-dh=
- =dvorak=, =programer-dvorak=
- =qwerty=, =qwerty-abnt=
- =qwertz=
- =workman=

For example, to use the =dvorak= layout, add the following to your layers list:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(xah-fly-keys :variables xah-fly-keys-layout "dvorak")
#+END_SRC

** Swap the leader keys
If you'd like to have the Spacemacs leader key on the space bar rather than the xah-fly-keys
menu, then it's possible to swap them.

I tried implementing this with a config variable, but it doesn't quite work as expected.
Until that is sorted out, add this to your =dotspacemacs/user-config= to swap the leader
keys for Spacemacs and xah-fly-keys.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun xah-fly-keys-swap-spacemacs-leader ()
      (progn
        (define-key xah-fly-key-map (kbd "SPC") 'spacemacs-cmds)
        (define-key xah-fly-key-map (kbd "M-m") 'xah-fly-leader-key-map)))

(add-hook 'xah-fly-command-mode-activate-hook 'xah-fly-keys-swap-spacemacs-leader)
#+END_SRC

You'll also need to set the =dotspacemacs-emacs-leader= key to an empty string.
It appears that sometimes the =which-key= menu will be affected by this change.

* Key bindings

See [[http://ergoemacs.org/misc/ergoemacs_vi_mode.html][xah-fly-keys]] for the modal keymap defined by Xah Lee.

** Sub keymaps

You'll notice that there are several sub keymaps after pressing a leader key.
These are organized by ease of use, and should really be categorized by
finger and keyboard row. I've listed some of the functionality for each of the
keymaps, but use =which-key= and you'll discover more details.

- 【SPC ,】 - Eval, kill emacs
- 【SPC k】 - registers, replace, occur
- 【SPC o】 - rectangles, macros, number registers
- 【SPC l】 - modes, view, windows
- 【SPC j】 - help, apropos, info
- 【SPC d】 - inserting chars, brackets, unicode
- 【SPC i】 - files, bookmarks, external apps
- 【SPC w】 - xref, find identifiers
- 【SPC e】 - search, highlight, fonts
- 【SPC TAB】 - indent, expand, abbrev
